                 <strong>Price: $84.5 million</strong>

                In June, Sotheby’s sold Francis Bacon’s massive painting Triptych Inspired by the Oresteia of Aeschylus (1981) for a hammer price of $74 million (or $84.5 million with buyers premium). The monumental work, which draws on a trilogy of Greek tragedies dating back to the 5th century B.C.E., came from the collection of Norwegian collector Hans Rasmus Astrup, who bought it in 1984; he had sold it to raise funds for his private foundation, the Astrup Fearnley Museet in Oslo. The work is the sixth large-scale triptych by Bacon to come to auction, and the first of its kind to appear on the block since 2014. It now marks the third-highest ever price achieved for a Bacon at auction.</p>

           <strong>Price: $41 million</strong>

            In early December, Phillips’s New York contemporary art evening sale brought in a total of $134.6 million, marking the highest total ever achieved for an evening sale in the house’s history. Among the works that made that record possible was David Hockney’s 7-by-5-foot painting Nichols Canyon (1980), which features a view of the landscape near the artist’s former California home. It had been sold from the collection of Seattle-based real-estate developer Richard Hedreen. Expected to reach a price of $35 million, the work ended up selling for a staggering $41 million, setting a record for a landscape by the British artist.

        <p>
           <strong> Price: $27.6 million</strong>

            Gerhard Richter’s abstractions, made by pulling paint across a canvas to create smudgy effects, tend to be hits in the auction world, and this one proved no exception to that rule. In October, Richter’s 1987 painting Abstraktes Bild (649-2), from the collection of Ronald Perelman, sold for a whopping HKD 214.6 million ($27.6 million) at Sotheby’s Hong Kong, minting a new record. It is now the most expensive work by a Western artist ever to sell at an Asian auction. The winning buyer was the Pola Museum of Art in Hakone, Japan.</p>

           <strong> Price: $41.8 million</strong>

            In October in Hong Kong, a rare Chinese classical scroll made a record price at Sotheby’s. A 700-year-old painting by Chinese painter and government official Ren Renfa titled Five Drunken Princes Returning on Horseback sparked a 75-minute-long bidding run, with more than 100 bids in the process. It wound up hammering at HKD 265 million, and selling for HKD 306 million ($41.8 million) with buyer’s fees, far exceeding the work’s $10 million–$15 million.</p>

            <strong> Price: $28.7 million</strong>
                Clyfford Still’s 1947-Y-No.1. Expected to fetch a price of $25 million–$35 million, the Still painting sold for $28.7 million with buyer’s fees in New York during the house’s live-streamed June evening sale. With the majority of Still’s works residing in the permanent collection of the Still Museum in Denver, few major works remain in private hands. A similar example by the artist, 1949-A-No. 1, set the artist’s record at $61.8 million at Sotheby’s in 2011.
